ModelDrivenRails Plugin
=======================

ModelDrivenRails is a RubyOnRails Plugin that generates models (and
their migrations, unit tests and fixtures) as well as their
associations' statements (belongs_to, has_many, ...) from an UML Class
Diagram.

Supported Features
==================

Supported is the DIA internal format. XMI support is in progress.

UMLwise it's currently pretty basic. Nothing fancy so far.

  classes
  properties
  associations
    1 - *
    0..1 - *
    * - * (doesn't generate join tables)

An Example
==========

Lets suppose you have an UML Class Diagram that looks similar to the
following and is stored in a file named 'diagram.dia'.

  -----------------  1             *  -------------------
  | Customer      |  ---------------  | Order           |
  |---------------|                   |-----------------|
  | +name: string |                   | +number: string |
  |---------------|                   |-----------------|
  -----------------                   -------------------

By calling the rake task 'uml:generate' like this:

  $ rake uml:generate filename=diagram.dia

the two models Customer and Order (and their migrations, unit tests
and fixtures) will be generated.

  $ cat app/models/order.rb
  class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
  	belongs_to :customer
  end
 
  $ cat app/models/customer.rb
  class Customer < ActiveRecord::Base
  	has_many :orders
  end
 
  $ cat db/migrate/001_create_orders.rb
  class CreateCustomers < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      create_table :orders do |t|
        t.string :number
        t.integer :customer_id
        t.timestamps
      end
    end
    def self.down
      drop_table :orders
    end
  end

I guess, you got it. Have fun.

FOR THE UNPATIENT WHO READ THE BOTTOM FIRST
